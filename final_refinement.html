									<h2>Consent Narrative</h2>
									<p>Some additional information on how we interact with our users and interviewees</p>
								</header>
								<section>
									<header>
										<h3>Purpose</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										We are students at Olin College of Engineering taking the
										course User Experience Design. The goal of this class is to
										understand and apply aspects of human interaction to the design
										of user-friendly software applications. By the end of the course,
										we hope to make a positive impact on low-income families preparing
										their children for college and parents whose children have already
										gone through the college application process.
									</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<header>
										<h3>Description</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Our goal is to investigate the way families tackle the college
										application process. We would like to observe how you use
										current college application resources and ask questions to
										pinpoint ways to improve the experience. We are also interested
										to know what sort of features you would like to see in college
										preparation applications. Everything during the course of the
										interview is optional, and you can end it at any time.
									</p>

										<h3>Techniques That May Be Used Upon Your Approval</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										We want to optimize the insights learned through our
										conversations and observations, so in order to track these,
										we will utilize numerous techniques including note taking,
										photography, and audio recording. With privacy at the forefront
										of our minds, we will ensure that you are comfortable with
										any notes or documentation recorded at all times.
									</p>
								</section>
								<section>

										<h3>Confidentiality</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Your name and contact information will remain strictly
										between our team and the teaching staff. We will use pseudonyms
										to maintain anonymity and omit any possible sensitive information
										from our reports and presentations. If at any time you wish to
										stop participating in our project, we will withdraw all of your
										information from our user data. We will also accommodate any
										additional requests or concerns you may have.
									</p>
								</section>

									<header>
										<h3>Time Commitment</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										This course lasts one semester (4 months) and we hope to meet
										with you a few times over the course of the project.
										Interviews will last about 30-45 minutes. We understand that
										you have other time commitments and will work around your
										schedule to the best of our ability.
									</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<header>
										<h3>Compensation</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										There will not be any monetary compensation for your time,
										but your feedback and discussions will be essential to our
										own learning and project goals. Our hope is to create a
										mutually beneficial relationship and learning experience.
