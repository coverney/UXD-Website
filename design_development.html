									<h2>Overall Process</h2>
									<p>For the design development phase, we focused on translating our user’s and persona’s needs into effective design decisions. </p>
								</header>
								<section>
									<header>
										<h3>What is the design?</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Our current design is focused on connecting empty nester
										parents to families applying to colleges for the first time. 
										Our users can create profiles and then get matched to empty 
										nesters or applicants. From there, empty nester parents can 
										give college application advice through forums, blog posts, 
										notifications, and essay editing platforms. We want to create a 
										friendly environment where our users can establish new connections 
										centered around the college application process. Even after the 
										application is completed, matched users are encouraged to keep 
										each other updated on college admission results.										
									</p>

										<h3>How is this design responsive to user needs?</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Considering our target user being closely related to our 
										“Relaxed Russels,” and “Busy Bailey” personas, we developed 
										both sides of our interface, the student-parent side and the 
										empty nester side, with the people who desire a simpler 
										interface that thoroughly conveys the messages and ideas 
										desired while being concise and easy to follow. The needs of 
										those who felt constrained on time along with those who were 
										in need of immediate assistance where primarily taken into account. 
										In designing our site, we took into account how our users felt on 
										tangibility vs. emotional outcome of this produce, while also keeping 
										into account their commitment levels. For one persona, “Overly 
										Available Olivers,” we saw that they served the group of empty 
										nesters who desired emotional connections as an outcome with 
										high commitment levels while another persona, “Busy Baileys,” 
										had low commitment level, but still desired something tangible 
										and emotional. Because of these observations, we developed our 
										site to include a matching system that is quick and simple, 
										in order to match the low commitment of “Busy Baileys” while 
										also keeping in account interests and skills for this matching systems. 
										This allows one to develop an emotional connection to the people they 
										help while still being helpful to students going through the 
										College Application Process.

										<h3>How well does it meet user needs? In what ways does it fall short?</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										From our user test with a current empty nester parent, we 
										learned that our service needs to be presented in a more 
										easy going light, rather than a business transaction. This 
										is because the purpose for the empty nester is to provide 
										their experience, along with helping young students similar 
										to their kids. In order to make this interaction more “personal” 
										our user suggested matches to “add a note” or a personal message 
										to their perspective matches. We also learned what our user did 
										like about the user experience. We learned that the user really 
										enjoys the setup separated by column because it resembles that of 
										an email inbox and they know how to navigate that. Furthermore, we 
										saw from testing that this type of user enjoys images and icons instead 
										of words. Lastly, the empty nester user wants to match with students/families 
										interested in the same school their child attends or type of school, because 
										it will lead to a more rich relationship.

										<h3>Ideating, Listening, & Iterating</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Starting the design development phase, we had a well-rounded 
										understanding of our users through 12 interviews, which we used to 
										create 4 personas. For each persona, we considered their values. Our goal 
										was to map values to features that our users would want. 
										<img src="" alt="Values">
										
										From persona values, we brainstormed features that directly connected with user values:
										<img src="" alt="Personas Values">
										
										We also considered user safety:

										Scenario brainstorming by persona:
										<img src="" alt="Scenario Image">
										
										Mapping features to scenarios:
										<img src="" alt="Feature Mapping">
										
										From there, we decided to create paper prototypes for the user profile and user 
										matching aspects of our project. The paper prototypes were ideal for iterating on 
										our ideas and finding aspects of our design that disagreed with user values. 
									</p>

										<h3>User Profile</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										We started designing the user profile by creating a bunch 
										of concept sketches, a few of which are shown below. We found 
										many commonalities among our sketches in terms of what sort of 
										information we should include in the user profile. We all agreed that 
										the following user attributes were necessary to collect:
										<ul>
										  	<li>Name</li>
										  	<li>Pronoun</li>
										  	<li>Empty Nester or Applicant Status</li>
										  	<li>Profile picture</li>
											<li>Languages</li>
											<li>Engagement Level</li>
											<li>Types of schools user is interested in or knows about</li>
											<li>Specific things user needs help in or can help with</li>
										</ul>
										Additionally, we thought of some nice-to-have features that could be used 
										to generate better matches:
										<ul>
										  	<li>Hobbies</li>
										  	<li>Goals relevant to the matching service</li>
										  	<li>Location(used to generate a map of rough location of where the user is located</li>
										</ul>
										<img src="" alt="Profile Concept Sketch">
										Considering user safety, we decided to keep the user profiles private with a 
										separate, more general baseball-card like public profile that would be used in the 
										matching process. We integrated our concept sketches into the user profile 
										template shown below.
										<img src="" alt="Profile Template Sketch">
										While we did not focus on user profiles in our usability tests, we received some
										relevant feedback, such as having filled in circles instead of sliding bars to 
										represent engagement level, encouraging profile pictures over avatars, and making
										sure to thoroughly walk through the profile creation process step by step. We plan 
										to take inspiration from the dating app, Hinge’s onboarding process, in which we ask 
										for user information in an interactive and conversational manner.

										<h3>User Matching</h3>

									<p>
										There will not be any monetary compensation for your time,
										but your feedback and discussions will be essential to our
										own learning and project goals. Our hope is to create a
										mutually beneficial relationship and learning experience.

										In this phase, I focused on the iteration and 
										critical thinking driving the paper prototypes 
										as I created drafts and think of pros and cons 
										for each iteration for our matching system.
