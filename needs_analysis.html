                <p>
                  When first entering the world of college applications, it can
                  be very daunting- especially to parents experiencing this wild
                  ride for the first time. Tutors, concelours, financial aid,
                  SATs, ACTs, superscore, subjects tests - these are just a few
                  of the terms that you often hear when a student is applying to
                  college. And this crucial time can be even more challenging to
                  parents of low-income families that cannot afford fancy college
                  counselors or tutors or all the books on college.
                  <br><br>
                  Our project
                  strives to connect two user groups, parents with children who
                  left for college (i.e. empty nesters), and parents of highschool
                  juniors and seniors that are just beginning to learn about the
                  application process. We believe that empty nesters have the
                  potential to serve as an invaluable source/ guide to new
                  college-applicant parents who do not already have access to or
                  knowledge of college application resources. From what are the
                  best SAT prep books/tutors, to how to apply for financial aid,
                  to the benefits of ED versus EA- these parents have experienced
                  it and are usually excited to share the knowledge. A side benefit
                  is that this also provides a hobby to newly empty nester parents
                  that are adjusting to life without their children at home. It's
                  a win-win.
                  <br><br>
                  Our app/webpage interface will allow empty nester parents and
                  new college-applicant parents to create profiles that will be
                  used to connect users, empty nester to new college applicant,
                  based on similar interests, experiences, student education, and
                  needs. The goal is to create a “social network experience” to
                  connect both sides. By establishing these connections, we hope
                  to make the college application process less daunting for families
                  who never went through it before, while providing a new hobby to
                  empty nester parents who have more free time after their children
                  left.
                  <br><br>
                  We identified our users’ needs through 12 interviews of both parents
                  who are going through the college application process for the
                  first time and empty nester parents. We talked to 7 empty nesters
                  and 5 new college-applicant parents. Before conducting a majority
                  of our interviews, we mapped the assumptions we had about our users.
                </p>
		<br><br>
                <img style="width:50%;height:auto;" src="images/assumption_map.jpg" alt="" />
		<br><br>
                <p>
                  We used these assumptions to come up with interview questions.
                  For empty nester parents, we wanted to check (1) whether they
                  miss their children, (2) how much free time do they have without
                  their children around, (3) what are they doing with their free
                  time, (4) how much were they involved in the college application
                  process, and (5) whether they would describe themselves as
                  knowledgeable people about the college process. For new college
                  application parents, we decided to focus on lower-income families
                  because they are a subset of our user group that we think would
                  benefit from this project the most. We wanted to check (1) what
                  college application resources do they know of and use, (2) how
                  involved they are in their children’s schooling, (3) what do
                  they think about applying to college, (4) which colleges that
                  want their children to apply to, and (5) whether they rely on
                  others in their communities to help them out.
                  <br><br>
                  After our interviews, we created 10 people portraits and used
                  what we learned to construct 4 personas, which both represent
                  our user group and other groups (i.e. Worrisome Wallies) that
                  we don’t plan to design for:

                <h3>Relaxed Russels</h3>
                <p>
                  This persona falls under the category of parents with children
                  currently applying to colleges. These parents are seen as having
                  a more “relaxed” and step back approach to the process. They
                  are very supportive but let the children take the lead and make
                  all the decisions. Therefore, they are less informed about the
                  process in general than their children. This does not mean they
                  do not care, they just think the child knows what's best and
                  are also occupied with full time positions. They also use only
                  free resources for the process unless the child asks for more
                  help. They make up the part of the new college-applicant parent
                  group that we are trying to help.

                <h3>Busy Baileys</h3>

                <p>
                  This persona falls under the category of empty nesters.
                  When their children were at home, both parents worked full time
                  jobs and already had busy lives. But because their children
                  have gone through the application process, they have a solid
                  base understanding of what it looks like and what needs to be
                  done from the parents end. Their children were very independent
                  and continue to be so. Now as empty nesters, they embrace the
                  new-found calmness around the house and try to plan on new
                  social activities or things to do on the weekends. Although
                  they do miss their children, they feel like they have their
                  lives back.

                <h3>Worrisome Wallies</h3>
                <p>
                  This persona falls under the category of parents with children
                  applying to colleges. These parents are very involved in the
                  process - maybe even overly. They most certainly know more
                  than the child and even have a copy of “Fiske’s guide to colleges”
                  on their bedside table.  They are very competitive with friends
                  who also have kids applying and this most often has to do with
                  their prestige thinking. They spend tons of money on the
                  application process and outside resources. Because of the
                  intensity of this persona, we decided they are the “anti-persona”
                  in that we do not want them to use our product, in fear that
                  they would drive the other customers away or discourage empty
                  nester parents from volunteering their advice.

                <h3>Overly Available Olivers</h3>
                <p>
                  This persona falls under the category of empty nesters.
                  Because they are and were stay at home/ retired during the
                  application process, they were very involved in their children’s
                  lives and the application process. Now that their kids are gone,
                  they feel like they have too much free time and are having a
                  tough time transitioning. They call their kids often and are
                  trying to find new hobbies or get back in tune with old ones.
                </p>
                <h3>OCEAN Design Framework</h3>
                <p>
                  In order to better understand and analyze our personas and
                  their needs, we used an OCEAN framework that ranks their
                  personality types. The categories are Openness,
                  Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism.
                  We learned from this framework that all of our personas are
                  around the same level of Extraversion, but range quite a bit in 
                  Neuroticism. In order to design a successful product, we need to
                  be able to design for our persona’s and their personalities.
