										<h3>Problem</h3>
									</header>
                  <i>What is the problem in brief?</i> <br><br>
									<p>
										When first entering the world of college applications,
                    it can be very daunting- especially to parents experiencing
                    this wild ride for the first time. Tutors, concelours,
                    financial aid, SATs, ACTs, superscore, subjects tests -
                    these are just a few of the terms that you often hear when
                    a student is applying to college. And this crucial time can
                    be even more challenging to parents of low-income families
                    that cannot afford fancy college counselors or tutors or all
                    the books on college.

										<h3>Our Solution</h3>
									</header>
                  <i>How will your project change the status quo? For whom?</i>
                  <br><br>
									<p>
										Our project strives to connect two user groups, parents with
                    children who left for college (i.e. empty nesters), and
                    parents of highschool juniors and seniors that are just
                    beginning to learn about the application process. We believe
                    that empty nesters have the potential to serve as an
                    invaluable source/ guide to new college-applicant parents.
                    From what are the best SAT prep books/tutors, to how to apply
                    for financial aid, to the benefits of ED versus EA- these
                    parents have experienced it and are usually excited to share
                    the knowledge. A side benefit is that this also provides a
                    hobby to newly empty nester parents that are adjusting to
                    life without their children at home. It's a win-win.

										<h3>First Draft Design Idea</h3>
									</header>
                  <i>What is (at least) one naïve design idea (rough sketch)?
                    How does this idea address what you see as the core problem?</i>
                  <br><br>
									<p>
										Users sign on via app/webpage interface. When signing up,
                    they create a profile in which they indicate:
                    empty nester/ new college applicant, school
                    familiarity/ interest, general area location, and
                    specific needs (i.e. financial aid process, student athletes).
                    The system will then connect users, empty nester to new
                    college applicant, based on similar interests, experiences,
                    student education, and needs. Overall, the concept is to
                    create a “social network experience” to connect both sides.

										<h3>The Data</h3>
									</header>
                  <i>What information do you need to collect? How will you
                    collect it? How will you meet your target users, or who
                    can serve as effective proxies for them?</i>
                  <br><br>
									<p>
                    The information we need to gather is:
                    <ul>
                      <li>What are the pain points current parents of college applicants feel?</li>
                      <li>What do they not know enough about?</li>
                      <li>How much money do they currently spend on the college application process?</li>
                      <li>How much do they learn from conclours vs doing their own research?</li>
                      <li>What did they wish they knew before beginning the application process (empty nesters)?</li>
                      <li>And more...</li>
                    </ul>
                    We will start our research process by reaching out to our
                    user groups. We plan to delve into our parents’ connections
                    to find both empty nesters and parents that are helping
                    their children apply to college for the first time. Once we
                    identify potential users, we will arrange phone/ Skype calls
                    to ask them the questions we listed above.

										<h3>Our Team</h3>
									</header>
                  <i>How will your team work together to accomplish these goals
                    (as well as your individual learning goals)?</i>
                  <br><br>
									<p>
										Our team will work together to accomplish this project by
                    equally distributing the work and abiding by our team
                    contract. We will also focus on the design thinking aspects
                    of our project and emphasize our individual learning goals,
                    which include:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Shy: Wants to develop his skills in front and back-hand
                        programming and gain more proficiency in software development
                        while including user input</li>
                      <li>Siena: Wants to improve design thinking skills,
                        wants to improve confidence with software skills</li>
                      <li>Cassandra: Wants to learn about design thinking and
                        apply software skills to design decisions</li>
                      <li>Sab: Wants to better understand and compare/contrast
                        different types of user interfaces to see how that
                        contributes to the overall product and experience, and
                        how UXD plays into product management</li>
                    </ul>
                    Shy, Siena, and Cassandra will probably be in charge of
                    future software implementations, and Sab will focus on
                    making sure we create the best interface for our users.
