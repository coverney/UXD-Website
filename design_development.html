									<h2>Design Development Phase</h2>
									<p>For the design development phase, we focused on translating
										our user’s and persona’s needs into effective design decisions.  </p>
								</header>
								<section>
									<header>
										<h3>What is the design?</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Our current design is focused on connecting empty nester parents to families applying to
										colleges for the first time. Our users can create profiles and then get matched to empty nesters
										or applicants. From there, empty nester parents can give college application advice through
										forums, blog posts, notifications, and essay editing platforms. We want to create a friendly
										environment where our users can establish new connections centered around the college
										application process. Even after the application is completed, matched users are encouraged to
										keep each other updated on college admission results.

									</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<header>
										<h3>How is this design responsive to user needs?</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										As our project involved two different user groups, we designed with both empty nesters and
										families applying to colleges in mind. Common to all of our users was the need for a simple,
										concise interface that is easy to navigate. However, it is particularly relevant to the personas
										“Busy Baileys” and “Relaxed Russels,” both of which have a limited time commitment and
										prefered minimalism over more features. It also makes sense for those who are in need of
										immediate application assistance.

										In designing our site, we also took into account how the tradeoff between our users’ feelings on
										tangibility vs. emotional outcome of this product. Our persona “Overly Available Olivers”
										describes empty nesters who value emotional connections and high commitment levels while
										“Busy Baileys” have relatively low commitment levels and desire tangible results over emotional
										connection. Because of these observations, we developed our site to include a matching system
										that is simple and quick. This matches with the lower commitment of our “Busy Baileys” persona
										while keeping in mind more holistic aspects such as interests and skills that the emotionally
										invested “Olivers” value. This balanced the emotional connection between our users while still
										making sure the students get the help they need with the college application process.

										<h3>Ideation Process</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Starting the design development phase, we had a well-rounded understanding of our users
										through 12 interviews, which we used to create 4 personas. For each persona, we considered
										their values. Our goal was to map values to features that our users would want.

										From the persona values, we brainstormed situations our users find themselves in and
										translated them into features that directly connected with their values. For example,
										“Overly-Available Olivers” are more prone to a sit-down environment when working so a
										platform for them could include features like autosave, break reminders, or a timer. Meanwhile,
										“Busy Baileys” has a time constraint and would benefit more from features such as a mobile
										platform, notifications with quick reply features, read receipts, or resource suggestions that they
										can link for their student.
										<br>
										<img style="width:40%;height:auto;" src="images/scenario.png" alt="Scenario Image">
										<img style="width:35.5%;height:auto;" src="images/feature_mapping.png" alt="Feature Mapping">
										<br>
										We also did some generic feature brainstorming that we grouped into 5 categories: user-website
										interaction, user-mentor interaction, time management, connection to resources, and user
										community.
										<br>
										<img style="width:40%;height:auto;" src="images/features.png" alt="Feature Brainstorming">
										<br>
										However, for this phase we chose to focus on the matching and user profile aspect of our
										website, so these features are not yet tested with our users.

										User safety was a constant concern for our design. We wanted to ensure a helpful and
										meaningful interaction between our users but had to design around unsafe situations such as
										inappropriate messages, users purposefully giving bad advice, implicit discrmination when
										matching, and college essay plagiarism. A few features we brainstormed relating to user safety
										include being able to end connections by choice and fact-checking advice.
										<br>
										<img style="width:30%;height:auto;" src="images/safety.png" alt="User Safety">
										<br>
										Finally, we decided to create paper prototypes for two very important aspects of our project: the
										user profile and user matching. The paper prototypes were ideal for iterating on our ideas and
										finding aspects of our designs that disagreed with user values.

										<h3>User Profile</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										We started designing the user profile by creating concept sketches, a few of which are shown
										below. We found many commonalities among our sketches in terms of what sort of information
										should be included in the user profile. We all agreed that the following user attributes were
										necessary to collect:

										<ul>
										  	<li>Name</li>
										  	<li>Pronoun</li>
										  	<li>Empty Nester or Applicant Status</li>
										  	<li>Profile picture</li>
												<li>Languages</li>
												<li>Engagement Level</li>
												<li>Types of schools user is interested in or knows about</li>
												<li>Specific things user needs help in or can help with</li>
										</ul>
										<img style="width:50%;height:auto;" src="images/profile.png" alt="Profile Concept Sketch">
										<br>
										Considering user safety, we decided to keep the user profiles private with a separate, more
										general baseball-card like public profile that would be used in the matching process. While we
										did not focus on user profiles in our usability tests, we received some relevant feedback, such
										as having filled in circles instead of sliding bars to represent engagement level, encouraging
										profile pictures over avatars, and making sure to thoroughly walk through the profile creation
										process step by step. We plan to take inspiration from the dating app, Hinge’s onboarding
										process, in which we ask for user information in an interactive and conversational manner.

										<h3>User Matching</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										We wanted to invest time to make sure we designed a user-matching interface that supports our
										goal of connecting empty nesters and college applicant families to form meaningful
										relationships. There were a few different ways we could match our users including suggesting
										matches based on user profiles, matching people based on tasks, and having college applicant
										families reach out to empty nesters that they are interested in working with. Using the concept
										sketches, we conducted four users tests, one with an empty nester and three with applying
										families.

										<br>
										<img style="width:50%;height:auto;" src="images/matching.png" alt="Matching Concept Sketch">
										<br>

										From our user test with a current empty nester parent, we learned that our service needs to be
										presented in a more easy going light, rather than a business transaction. This is because the
										purpose for the empty nester is to share their experiences, along with helping young students
										similar to their kids. To make this interaction more “personal”, our user suggested matches to
										“add a note” or a personal message to their perspective matches. We learned that our user
										really enjoys an interface separated by columns because it resembles that of an email inbox,
										and they know how to navigate that. Furthermore, we saw from testing that this type of user
										enjoys images and icons instead of words. Lastly, the empty nester user wants to match with
										students/families interested in the same school or type of school their child attends, because
										they believe it will lead to a more rich relationship.
										<br> <br>
										From the applying family tests, there were a wide range of ideas but the three main categories
										were general comments, comments on the task-matching format, and comments on the hero
										card format.
										<br> <br>
										Overall, the test users confirmed the idea that simplistic summaries were helpful, but there was
										a conflict between the applying-families’ and empty nesters’ perspectives about what the
										summaries should include. The students believed that the summaries should include more
										application-relevant information, especially because there was an inherent distrust of the match
										score or “best match” label seen in two of the interviews that points to a need for transparency
										in the matching process. However, the empty nester enjoyed being able to share and match on
										outside interests such as hobbies that encouraged emotional connections. This discrepancy is
										most likely due to the difference in the desired emotional vs tangible results and will have to be
										resolved in further iterations of our prototypes.
										<br><br>
										Besides this, there was also concern about the engagement level being shown to other users so
										in future iterations it should be used for matching only as a back-end algorithm. However, more
										match options are not needed as the two designs lent themselves to a nice balance of choice
										and simplicity. Specific comments about the preference for one format over the other tended
										towards the hero card idea. The test users liked the idea of a single, long-term contact to guide
										them both for the additional security and the personal connection. Otherwise, the test user
										mentioned that it would feel too business-like.
										<br><br>
										As for task-based matching comments, there was a consensus that the impersonal and
										results-focused concept would be best for families that already have some knowledge about the
										application process and/or those who would be comfortable being the driving brain behind the
										application process. This may not work very well for our persona “Relaxed Russels,” but could
										benefit “Busy Baileys.” There is also not enough emotional involvement for “Overly-Available
										Olivers.”
										<br><br>
										The hero card idea was generally more positively received because it gives the interface more
										personality and uses more icons/images than words. The test users liked the idea of one main
										contact as it was more personal and better for students who weren’t knowledgeable about the
										application process. However, the current format has a less intuitive interaction method in that it
										looks more suited to swiping or dragging than scrolling and clicking. One user mentioned that
										the large amount of space each card took up was good for quickly understanding potential
										matches but if the match is for a long-time they would be willing to invest even more time to
										learn about the match. Lastly, if the match is one on one, the empty nester or third party should
										initiate the conversation in order set an interaction expectation.
